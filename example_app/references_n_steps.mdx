okay - now trying to get this cloned from a git repo
then built
then deployed

So Clone from repo
Currently we're gonna just build and deploy locally
probaly can also install container registry on cluster


ok
Jul 25
now I'm looking at talos linux
https://www.talos.dev/v1.7/talos-guides/install/local-platforms/docker/

Looks like a way more secure way of doing things
also this
https://github.com/xunholy/k8s-gitops/tree/main

Looks like it may take care of everything for me to some extent
The question is getting the homelab up and running and then accessible 
basically - no one access the cluster
that is done via flux
people access github and make commits

those get pushed and the flux deploys
there's 
sys admins - the SRE's they manage the running env
setup of the stuff

developers write code

business people get access to applications that have user management as part of the app
this is for agile tooling being built

everyday users have their own instance of tools and data 

learner


-----

So 
go home
install talos on proxmox
install flux cd there and connect it to the git repo
deploy the example app etc

look into the rasbernettes setup and replicating that


Step 1: Generate Your SSH Key

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "example@example.com"
Step 2: Use the Key

$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Then add the key we just generated. If you selected a different path than the default, be sure to replace that path in the command.

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Step 3: Add the SSH Key on GitHub

clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
if clip not found then add the next command

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Finally Result something like on your cmd

ssh-rsa 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 youremail@gmail.com
copy from your cmd and go to your GitHub account setting find ssh and gpg keys
